## Welcome to My GitHub! ðŸš€

### ðŸ‘¤ About Me:

Hello! I'm **Shubham Pandya**, a data enthusiast and engineering professional based in Boston, MA. Currently, I'm advancing my skills by pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics and Engineering at Northeastern University, with an expected graduation in August 2024. With a solid foundation in mechanical engineering and a deep passion for data-driven solutions, I've transitioned into data engineering, where I strive to bridge the gap between data and actionable insights.

During my co-op at Wolfspeed and my tenure at Larsen & Toubro Infotech, I've developed robust data pipelines, implemented efficient data integrations, and led analytics projects that significantly improved operational efficiencies. My academic projects, such as optimizing HVAC unit logistics, classifying census income levels, and predicting cab service prices, highlight my ability to apply theoretical knowledge in practical, impactful ways.
